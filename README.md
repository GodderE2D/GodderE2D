Mostly everyone calls me Godder online, if you know my real name you can call me that. Just not around with people who don't know[…](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxing)

## About me

I'm a self-taught developer on GitHub to host my projects and contribute to other open-source ones. I usually code in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and have interests in Discord bots, web dev, and technical Minecraft.

I was born in Sydney, Australia but I currently reside in Virginia, United States for school. I play a lot of video games, like [VALORANT](https://tracker.gg/valorant/profile/riot/GodderE2D%23ruby/overview), [Minecraft](https://namemc.com/profile/28b0a9f9-65c1-450b-abeb-da9bf3d5830a), Fortnite, and more. You can find me on Discord as `thee2d` in servers like [Blue Shark River](https://discord.gg/R2FDvcPXTK), [discord.js](https://discord.gg/djs), and [Y0ken's Domain](https://discord.gg/BmNGZW2).

## My projects

Right now, I'm focusing on [Blue Shark River](https://discord.gg/R2FDvcPXTK) with my Discord bot [Reindeer](https://reindeer.bsr.gg/) and [Fortalice SMP](https://www.planetminecraft.com/server/fortalice-smp-1-19-friendly-smp/). I was also working on [Modslides](https://github.com/modslides), which is an online moderation documentation and glorified forum.

## Ruby references

You might hear me reference rubies a lot. Well, rubies are my favourite gemstones. Is there more to that? Truly a mystery.
