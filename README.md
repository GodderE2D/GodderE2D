Have time? Please check out [Wolvesville Utopium](https://wolvesville.utopium.xyz), a simulation game based off [Wolvesville](https://app.wolvesville.com), an online party game.

However, Wolvesville Utopium is fully simulated on Discord! You can play with your friends at anytime, anywhere soon™!

It's currently dead right now, so if you could check it out, it would mean a lot to me, and the developers, staff, and members there! Thanks a lot 😊
