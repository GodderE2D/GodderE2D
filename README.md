Have time? Please check out [Wolvesville Utopium](https://wolvesville.utopium.xyz), a simulation game based off [Wolvesville](https://app.wolvesville.com), an online party game.

However, Wolvesville Utopium is fully simulated on Discord! You can play with your friends at anytime, anywhere soon‚Ñ¢!

It's currently dead right now, so if you could check it out, it would mean a lot to me, and the developers, staff, and members there! Thanks a lot üòä

### Recommendations

‚ÑπÔ∏è I am not affiliated or sponsored by any of these services. This is purely recommendations and you do not need to use them.

#### Discord Servers
* [Y0ken's Domain](https://discord.gg/BmNGZW2): Best Discord server for great games and guides, including Discord help*
* [Wolvesville Utopium](https://wolvesville.utopium.xyz/): A simulation of Wolvesville, completely in Discord

\* I had been a staff member in Y0ken&apos;s Domain, therefore my review may be slightly biased.

#### Discord Bots
* [Dyno](https://dyno.gg/): Best multipurpose Discord bot to start out with, if you have some experience on Discord
* [MEE6](https://mee6.xyz/): Best multipurpose Discord bot to start out with, if you have little-to-no experience on Discord
* [Statbot](https://statbot.net/): A Discord bot for server statistics and insights
* [Ticket Tool](https://tickettool.xyz): A Discord bot for ticketing, could be used for staff tickets, help tickets, etc
* [AmariBot](https://amaribot.com/): Best levelling bot that includes role levels, customisable XP, etc
* [Santa Lunar](https://forum.lunarisx.com/): A Discord bot for advanced giveaways with customisable requirements and features
* [Xenon](https://xenon.bot/): Best Discord server backup bot if you do not prefer server templates with tons of advanced features

**All of the above** offers a premium subscription, however, I am reviewing the free tier of the service.
