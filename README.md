## About me

I'm mostly a self-taught developer and I showcase my projects and contribute to open source on GitHub. I usually code in TypeScript or Java and have interests in Discord bots, web dev, technical Minecraft, and cybersecurity.

I was born in Sydney, Australia but I currently reside in Virginia, United States for school. I play games like Fortnite, Minecraft, VALORANT and more in my free time. You can find me on Discord as GodderE2D or thee2d in servers like [Blue Shark River](https://discord.gg/R2FDvcPXTK), [discord.js](https://discord.gg/djs), [CyberStudents](https://discord.gg/cyberstudents-916144903686336513) and [Y0ken's Domain](https://discord.gg/BmNGZW2).
