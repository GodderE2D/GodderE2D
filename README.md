Mostly everyone calls me Godder online, if you know my real name you can call me that. Just not around with people who don't know[â€¦](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxing)

My old Discord account, [GodderE2D]#7290, was disabled by Discord due to violation of ToS. [Learn more.](https://gist.github.com/GodderE2D/f24263df5b9e932805ccc2db04709726)

## About me

I'm a mostly self-taught developer and I'm on GitHub to host my own projects and to contribute to other open-source technologies. I usually code in [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and learning [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/), and blazingly-fast [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

I was born in Sydney, Australia ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º but I currently reside in Virginia, United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸. I also lived in Shanghai, China ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ where most of my life took place. I'll tell you one thing, I'm not twenty yet. I play a lot of video games too, including [VALORANT](https://playvalorant.com/) ([my tracker.gg](https://tracker.gg/valorant/profile/riot/GodderE2D%23ruby/overview)), [Fortnite](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/home), and [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us) ([my NameMC](https://namemc.com/profile/azu4.3)).

I'm mostly a web developer and a Discord bot-developer refugee, but I'm also experimenting with game dev (mostly [UE5](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/unreal-engine-5)). You can mostly find me on [Discord](https://discord.com) online in the [discord.js server](https://discord.gg/djs) and [Y0ken's Domain](https://discord.gg/BmNGZW2).

## My projects

I'm working on [Modslides](https://github.com/modslides), which is an online moderation documentation and glorified forum. I like to contribute to my friends' projects too, such as [Disploy](https://github.com/Disploy). Some of my side projects are [quickpostgres](https://github.com/GodderE2D/quickpostgres), [Athena but better](https://github.com/GodderE2D/athena-but-better), and [my website](https://github.com/GodderE2D/godder.xyz).

## Let's work together!

I'm not looking for new non-paid collaborative work for now, but you can hire me! I don't really have any certifications, but my GitHub and [my website](https://www.godder.xyz) are some resources. I'm semi-proficient in JavaScript/TypeScript, React/Next.js, and I know a lot about the technical aspects of Discord. So Discord bots and websites are my comfort zone.

### Ruby references

You might hear me reference rubies a lot. Well, rubies are my favourite gemstones. Is there more to that? Truly a mystery.
